    D1SCO is a platform for communities centred around a love for music. It's a
    place where people can share, discuss and discover music.
</p>
<p>
    It is a project that we ourselves at 2V3.studio dreamt up and decided to
    turn into reality. A priority for this project was to create a working
    version of the idea in a short period of time. From outlining the
    specification to having initial users on the platform and testing it took
    only 3 weeks.

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>
    We followed our usual design process of first making it very clear what we
    wanted the prototype to do. This is something we usually do over video calls
    with clients. The specification of the platform was:
    <li>Log-in and sign-up system</li>
    <li>The ability to search for any song, album or artist</li>
    <li>A way of sharing a song/album/artist with a text caption</li>
    <li>Likes and threaded comments on posts</li>
</p>
<p>
    Once we'd finalised our specification, we went on to wireframe the web app.
</p>
<blockquote>
    A wireframe is a visual representation or skeletal outline of a digital
    interface or design, illustrating the layout and basic elements without
    detailed design elements or graphics.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Instead of desigining the entire UI, we desigined the rough style we wanted
    a post to follow and then let the rest of the design follow ad hoc during
    development. Although we wouldn't usually do this, it enabled us to start
    development sooner and make progress more quickly.
</p>
<h3>Develop</h3>
<p>
    To develop the web app, we used a tech stach that we have lots of experience
    with. This is comprised of:
    <li>Svelte / SvelteKit for frontend</li>
    <li>Vercel for hosting</li>
    <li>Firebase for backend</li>
</p>
<p>
    Instead of building our own catalog of all songs and artists, we used the <a
        href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api"
        >Spotify Api</a
    >. This allowed us to enable search within the web app, a key part of our
    specification.
</p>
<h3>Release</h3>
<p>
    We decided to host D1SCO through Vercel using a testing url <a href="/"
        >www.D1SCO.vercel.app</a
    >. This allowed us to publish the website live without having to buy a
    domain so that we could get user feedback before committing to a name and
    brand.
</p>
<p>
    When we work with clients, we will host their website on a testing url so
    they can see the website before it gets published live to their domain.
