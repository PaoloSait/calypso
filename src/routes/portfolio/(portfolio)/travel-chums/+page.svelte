            The client for this project was the Travel Chums, a startup looking
            to create a travel social app. The premise of the app is that it can
            be used by people travelling to meet and chat with other people
            travelling in the same location as them.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
            As the idea for the app was still in early stages, the client was
            happy for us to give us a less detailed brief and allow us to be
            more creative in our design. We structured the project as two
            stages:
        </p>
        <li>
            MVP - Creating a basic working prototype of the app for beta testing
        </li>
        <li>Creating a publishable app based on the feedback from the MVP</li>
        <h3>Working on the MVP</h3>
        <p>
            The MVP (minimal viable product) was planned to take no more than 3
            weeks. A more stripped-down brief of the app was made, including the
            core features needed to test the app. Some of these included:
        </p>
        <li>Login, onboarding and profile creating</li>
        <li>An explore page to find other users</li>
        <li>A 'Chums' page to see your friends</li>
        <li>
            Chat feature - the ability to have 1-1 conservations with your
            friends
        </li>
        <li>Settings page</li>
        <li>Push notifications</li>
        <p>
            All the features were finished and ready to be tested by the clients
            beta testing group.
        </p>
