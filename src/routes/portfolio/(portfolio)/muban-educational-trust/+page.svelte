<h1>Muban Educational Trust</h1>

    The client for this project was the Muban Educational Trust, a small
    non-profit dedicated to the preservation, conservation and development of an
    extensive collection of Chinese woodcut prints.
</p>
<p>
    The client already had an existing website which was very outdated. It
    wasn't designed for mobile, it didn't have SSL (security certificate) and
    had even been hacked on certain pages.
</p>
<h3>Development Process</h3>
<p>
    We discussed with the client what they wanted changed from the old website
    and what they needed the new website to do. The client wanted the website to
    be easily self-maintained through a no-code service, so we opted to use
    Squarespace to build the website. Although these don't require code
    knowledge, we were able to add custom code to make the website exactly how
    the client wanted - beyond the constraints of what Squarespace usually
    offers.

<h3>Publishing</h3>
<p>
    We had lots of back-and-forth discussions about what the client did and
    didn't like during the development process. Once the website was exactly as
    the client wanted, we moved to publishing the website where the previous one
    was.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to deploying a website for a client it all starts with the
    domain. If the client doesn't have a domain, we will help them purchase one
    through a domain registrar. If they do, as in this case, we will update the
    domain's DNS records to deploy the website live. If this is the first time
    the domain is being used, we will then make sure the website is added to
    Google and that the SEO is as expected. In this scenario, the website already
    appeared on Google in the form of the old website. To fix this, we used the
    Google Search Console to make sure Google knew the website had been changed
    and understand the layout of the new website.
